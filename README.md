# glow-bash
Bash scripts to interact with the Hildebrand Glow API

#Release Notes
1.0.0 : Intial release with authentication and resources framework 
        in place, provides a live view of electricity consumption

# Usage

Run the script:

./glowbash.sh

When run for the first time, the script will prompt for your glow 
username and password.  From this an API token is generated by calling 
and stored locally on the filesystem.  You will not need to enter the 
username and password again unless the token is approaching its expiry date.

# Notes

This script has been written as a means of getting to know the API ahead of 
more useful development work.

# Troubleshooting

Check that the .token_save and .resources_save files are being populated.
They can safely be removed if they are corrupt - the script will regenerate

#To Do

The script has only been tested on MacOS - needs to be tested on Linux
Other aspects of the API to be added with command line options to choose
